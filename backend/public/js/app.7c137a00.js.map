It really matters and then like it really doesn’t matter. What matters\n        is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like\n        offended by it, it doesn’t matter. Because it&#39;s motivating the\n        doers. Because I’m here to follow my dreams and and inspire other people\n        to follow their dreams, too.\n        <br />\n        We’re not always in the position that we want to be at. We’re constantly\n        growing. We’re constantly making mistakes. We’re constantly trying to\n        express ourselves and actualize our dreams. If you have the opportunity\n        to play this game of life you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of\n        people don’t appreciate the moment until it’s passed.\n      </accordion-item>\n\n      <accordion-item\n        accordion-id=\"headingThree\"\n        collapse-id=\"collapseThree\"\n        question=\"How much time does it take to receive the order?\"\n      >\n        The time is now for it to be okay to be great.
